2. __Are there professions which are more prone to living outside of city limits?__ Use heat mapping to identify professions that most often elect to live outside city limits.
3. __Are there logical groupings to the professions that live outside the city?__ Cluster analysis on employee data to see where there is overlap in characteristics, then qualitatively summarize professions.
